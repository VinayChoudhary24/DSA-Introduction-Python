###Question
Problem statement
You are given a number 'n'. Return "true" if the given number is a palindrome or "false" otherwise.

Note:
You don’t need to print anything, it has already been taken care of, just complete the given function. “true” will be printed if the returned value 
is "true "and “false” otherwise.

Answer:
def palindromeNumber(n: int) -> bool:
    original_num = n
    reverse = 0
    while n > 0:
        last_digit = n % 10
        reverse = reverse * 10 + last_digit
        n //= 10
    return original_num == reverse

result = palindromeNumber(1234)
print(result)


###Question
Check Armstrong Number

Answer:
def digit_count(n):
    result = 0
    while n > 0:
        result += 1
        n = n // 10
    return result

def check_armstrong_number(num):
    count = digit_count(num)
    sum_of_digits = 0
    original_num = num
    while num > 0:
        last_digit = num % 10
        sum_of_digits += last_digit ** count
        num = num // 10
    return sum_of_digits == original_num

###Question
"""
Problem statement
Given an integer n, find and Return the factorial of the given integer.

Notes:
The Factorial of a whole number 'n' is defined as the product of that number with every whole number less than or equal to 'n' till 1.
For example, the factorial of 4 is 4 × 3 × 2 × 1, which is equal to 24.

###Question
"""
Your task is to write a function named print_composite that prints if there are any composite numbers up to a 
given number, n.

Composite numbers are positive integers greater than 1 that have more than two positive divisors. 
In other words, a composite number has factors other than 1 and itself.

###Question:
"""
Problem statement
Given three values - Start Fahrenheit Value (S), End Fahrenheit value (E) and Step Size (W), you need to convert all Fahrenheit values from Start to End at the gap of W, into their corresponding Celsius values and print the table.

Note: You don't have to write the main function or take input. It has already been taken care of and you need to just print the integer value . Just write the code that prints Fahrenheit to Celsius table in the function itself.
Formula is C = (F - 32) * 5/9
