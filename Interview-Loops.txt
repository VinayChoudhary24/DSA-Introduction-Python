## Problem statement
Question: Given a number N, print sum of all even numbers from 1 to N.

Answer one: Using Range
N = int(input())

even_sum = 0

# Loop through numbers from 1 to N
for i in range(1, N + 1):
    if i % 2 == 0:
        even_sum += i

# Print the sum of even numbers
print(even_sum)

Answer two: Using while Loop
N = int(input())

# Initialize variables
i = 1
even_sum = 0

while i <= N:
     if i % 2 == 0:
        even_sum += i
     i += 1

print(even_sum)


##Break, Continue and Pass

#Example 
num = 1

while (num <= 10):
      if num == 10:
      print("This is Pass")
      pass # To be Replaced with Logic later
      if num == 24:
      break # Going Out of the while Loop
      if num % 2 != 0:
         n += 1
         continue # Going to the While loop Again
      
      print(num)
      n += 1

## Problem Statement
Question: print Individual numbers in Reverse order 

Answer: if we done have range values clear we prefer while loop. 

N = int(input())
while N > 0: 
    rem = N % 10 # it Gives us the last digit
    print(rem, end=" ")
    N //= 10 # It eliminates the last digit


Problem statement
Question: Write a program to generate the reverse of a given number N. Print the corresponding reverse number.

Note : If a number has trailing zeros, then its reverse will not include them. For e.g., reverse of 10400 will 
be 401 instead of 00401.

Answer: 
n = int(input())
reverse = 0
while n > 0:
    rem = n % 10
    reverse = reverse * 10 + rem  # Build the reversed number
    n //= 10
print(reverse)


## Fibonacci Series 
Question: Print the series in Fibonacci i.e take the input from user to print how many fib. numbers

Answer:  
n = int(input())

second_last_num = 0
last_num = 1

print(second_last_num)
print(last_num)

count = 2 # how many fib numbers we want i.e n

while count <= n:
    next_fib = last_num + second_last_num
    print(next_fib)
    second_last_num = last_num
    last_num = next_fib

    count += 1

## Fibonacci Series 
Question: Print the Last Number(nth) in series for Fibonacci i.e take the input from user to print last number

Answer: 
n = int(input())

second_last_num = 0
last_num = 1

if n == 1:
    print(second_last_num)
elif n == 2:
    print(last_num)
else:
    count = 3
    while count <= n:
        next_fib = last_num + second_last_num
        second_last_num = last_num
        last_num = next_fib
        count += 1
    print(last_num)


##Decimal to Binary
Question: Convert a given (n) number into Binary

Answer: 
n = int(input())
ans = ""

while n > 0:
    if n % 2 == 0:
        #Even
        ans = "0" + ans
    else:
        #Odd
        ans = "1" + ans
    n //= 2
print(ans)

Answer2: Handle the Zero(0) Value
n = int(input())
ans = ""

if n == 0:
    print("0")
else:
    while n > 0:
        if n % 2 == 0:
            #Even
            ans = "0" + ans
        else:
           #Odd
           ans = "1" + ans
        n //= 2
    print(ans)


##Binary to decimal
Question: Convert the give binary to decimal

Ans:
n = int(input())

ans = 0 
power_of_2 = 1 # 2 raise to the power 0
while n > 0:
    last_digit = n % 10 # remainder
    ans += last_digit * power_of_2

    power_of_2 *= 2
    n //= 10 #eliminate the last digit
    
print(ans)

##print the Table 
for value in range(1, 21):
    for i in range(1, 11):
        print(value*i, end=" ")
    print()

## Print the Table using While Loop
value = 1
while value <= 20:
    i = 1
    while i <= 10:
        print(value * i, end=" ")
        i += 1
    value += 1
    print()

Problem statement
Question: Write a Python program that generates multiplication tables for numbers from 1 to a given integer N.

Answer:
n = int(input())
for value in range(1, n + 1):
    for i in range(1, 11):
        print(value*i, end=" ")
    print()

###Problem statement
Write a program that asks the user for a number N and a choice C. And then give them the possibility to choose between computing the sum and computing the product of all integers in the range 1 to N (both inclusive).


If C is equal to -
 1, then print the sum
 2, then print the product
 Any other number, then print '-1' (without the quotes)

Answer:
n = int(input())
c = int(input())

#check user choice
if c == 1:
    total = 0
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        total += i
    print(total)
elif c == 2:
    product = 1
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        product *= i
    print(product)
else:
    print(-1)

###Problem statement
Write a program to find x to the power n (i.e. x^n). Take x and n from the user. You need to print the answer.

Note :
For this question, you can assume that 0 raised to the power of 0 is 1

Answer:
x, n = input().split()
x =int(x)
n= int(n)
# write your code logic and no need to take input !
# Handle 0^0 as 1 (as per note)
if x == 0 and n == 0:
    print(1)
else:
    result = 1
    for i in range(n):
        result *= x
    print(result)


##Problem statement
Write a program to print the first x terms of the mathematical series 3N + 2 which are not multiples of 4.

The series is defined as:

T(N) = 3N + 2, where N is a positive integer starting from 1. Your task is to print the first x terms of this series, but you should exclude any term that is a multiple of 4.

Answer:
# Take input from the user
x = int(input())

count = 0   # how many valid terms we've printed
n = 1       # starting value of N

while count < x:
    term = 3 * n + 2
    if term % 4 != 0:
        # Skip multiple of 4
        print(term, end=" ")
        count += 1
    n += 1


##Problem statement
Given three values - Start Fahrenheit Value (S), End Fahrenheit value (E) and Step Size (W), you need to convert all Fahrenheit values from Start to End at the gap of W, into their corresponding Celsius values and print the table.

Hint : Use type casting

Answer:
S = int(input())
E = int(input())
W = int(input())

while S <= E:
    celsius = int((S - 32) * 5 / 9) # Type Casting
    print(f"{S}\t{celsius}")
    S += W


## Example-- Check if Number is prime or Composite
N = int(input())
isPrime = True
i = 2

while i <= N - 1:
    if N % i == 0:
        #This is Composite Number
        isprime = False
        break
    i += 1
if isPrime:
    print("This is Prime number")
else:
    print("This is Composite number")
print("While Loop ends")


##Problem statement
Given an integer N, print all the prime numbers that lie in the range 2 to N (both inclusive).

Print the prime numbers in different lines.

Answer:
n = int(input())

for num in range(2, n + 1):
    isPrime = True
    # Check if num is divisible by any smaller number
    for i in range(2, int(num ** 0.5) + 1):
        if num % i == 0:
            isPrime = False
            break
    if isPrime:
        print(num)
