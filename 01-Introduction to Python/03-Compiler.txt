## TRANSALATORS - They take the the code and translate into machine binary.

## Compiler - is one of the translators. it compiles and gives us the final executable setup file. .exe .apk etc

## Reads the whole file at once and gives final setup, if there are erros will call out all the errors at once.

## if there is any error in the file it will not execute any single line.
