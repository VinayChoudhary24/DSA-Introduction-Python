###Question
Given a 2D integer array with n rows and m columns. Print the 0th row from input n times, 
1st row n-1 times…..(n-1)th row will be printed 1 time.

Answer:
def print_pattern(arr):
    if len(arr) == 0:
        return

    n = len(arr)

    for i in range(n):
        repeat = n - i

        for _ in range(repeat):
            print(*arr[i])

n, m = map(int, input().split(" "))
arr = [list(map(int, input().split(" "))) for _ in range(n)]
print_pattern(arr)

###Question
Given a string S (that can contain multiple words), you need to find the word which has minimum length.

Note : If multiple words are of same length, then answer will be first minimum length word in the string. 
Words are seperated by single space only.

Answer:
## Read input as specified in the question.
## Print output as specified in the question.
def check_min_word(sen):
    words_arr = sen.split(" ")

    min_word = words_arr[0]

    for w in words_arr:
        if len(w) < len(min_word):
            min_word = w

    return min_word

n = input()

check_min_word_res = check_min_word(n)
print(check_min_word_res)

 this is the example

###Question
Given an integer array A of size n. Find and print all the leaders present in the input array. 
An array element A[i] is called Leader, if all the elements following it (i.e. present at its right) are 
less than or equal to A[i].

Print all the leader elements separated by space and in the same order they are present in the input array.

Answer:
## Read input as specified in the question.
## Print output as specified in the question.
def print_leader(arr):
    if len(arr) == 0:
        return
    
    n = len(arr)
    leaders = []

    max_from_right = arr[-1]
    leaders.append(max_from_right)

    # Traverse from second last to First
    for i in range(n-2, -1, -1):
        if arr[i] >= max_from_right:
            leaders.append(arr[i])
            max_from_right = arr[i]

    # leaders are stored in reverse order so we need to reverse them again
    leaders.reverse()

    print(*leaders)

arr = list(map(int, input().split(" ")))
print_leader(arr)

###Question
Write as you speak is a special sequence of strings that starts with string “1” and after one iteration you rewrite the sequence as whatever you speak.

Example :
The first few iterations of the sequence are :
First iteration: “1”
    As we are starting with one.

Second iteration: “11”
    We speak “1” as   “one 1” then we write it as “11”

Third iteration: “21”
    We speak “11” as “Two 1” then we write it as “21”

Fourth iteration: “1211”
    We speak “21” as “one 2, one 1”  then we write it as “1211”

Fifth iteration: “111221”
    We speak “1211” as “one 1, one 2, two 1” then we write it as “111221”

Sixth iteration: “312211”
    We speak “111221” as “three 1, two 2, one 1” then we write it as “312211”
You will be given a single positive integer N, Your task is to write the sequence after N iterations.

Answer:
def writeAsYouSpeak(n):
    """
    Generates the Nth term of the 'Write as you speak' (Look-and-Say) sequence.
    
    Args:
        n (int): The iteration number (1-based).

    """
    # Base case: The first term is always "1"
    if n == 1:
        return "1"
    
    # Start with the first term
    current_term = "1"
    
    # Iterate from 2 up to n to generate subsequent terms
    for _ in range(n - 1):
        next_term = []
        count = 1
        
        # Traverse the current string
        for i in range(len(current_term)):
            # If we are at the last character OR the next character is different
            if i == len(current_term) - 1 or current_term[i] != current_term[i+1]:

        current_term = "".join(next_term)
        
    return current_term
