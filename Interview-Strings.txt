#Mutability: when we create a variable, it gets a location in memory and when we try to update it on
the same location in memory it is called mutability.

#Immutability: when we create a variable, it gets a location in memory and when we try to update, 
it gets a new location in memory again it is called immutability.

#Mutable/Immutable Example: when we write something on a paper using pencil we can erase it and write on the 
same line and place i.e mutability. if we use a pen we cannot erase it and we need to write on a different 
place i.e immutability.

##In Python Lists/Arrays are Mutable.

###Question
Find the Character in the string i.e how many times a character is repeated

Answer:
def check_char_freq(string, char):
    idx = 0
    count = 0
    while idx < len(string):
        if string[idx] == char:
            count += 1
        idx += 1
    return count

check_char_freq("happy birthday", "h")

Answer using for Loop:
def check_char_freq(string, char):
    count = 0
    for idx in range(0, len(string)):
        if string[idx] == char:
            count += 1
        idx += 1
    return count

Answer: Another Version:
def check_char_freq(string, char):
    count = 0
    for curr_char in string:
        if curr_char == char:
            count += 1
    return count

print(email[1:5])
inay

email = "vinaychoudhary2401@gmail.com"
print(email[-6:-1])
il.co

email = "vinaychoudhary2401@gmail.com"
print(email[0:6:2])
vny

email = "vinaychoudhary2401@gmail.com"
print(email[-2:-6:-1])
oc.l

email = "vinaychoudhary2401@gmail.com"
print(email[::-1])
moc.liamg@1042yrahduohcyaniv


###Question

###Question
Check if the given string is Palindrome or not

Answer:
def check_palindrome(string):
    n = len(string) #length of string
    i = 0 # low pointer starts from left most
    j = n - 1 # high pointer starts from right most
    while i <= j: # we need to make sure we dont loop if low and high cross each other 
        if string[i] != string[j]:
            return False
        i += 1 # move low pinter to the right
        j -= 1 # move high pointer to the left
    return True

check_palindrome("naman")


###Question
String Interpolation i.e how to add a Variable with sting

Answer:
name = "Vinay"
email = "VC@gmail.com"

print("my name is: %s and email is: %s"%(name, email))
my name is: Vinay and email is: VC@gmail.com

Another Example Using Float and get 2 decimal:
num = 12.3488
print("the num is %.2f"%(num))

the num is 12.35

Another Example Using Foramt Function:
name = "Vinay"
email = "VC@gmail.com"

print("my name is: {} and email is: {}".format(name, email))
my name is: Vinay and email is: VC@gmail.com

Another Example Using Index in Format:
name = "Vinay"
email = "VC@gmail.com"

print("my name is: {1} and email is: {0}".format(name, email))
my name is: VC@gmail.com and email is: Vinay


Another but very important Example Using f"Strings":

name = "Vinay"
email = "VC@gmail.com"
value = f"my name is: {name} and email is: {email}"
print(value)

my name is: Vinay and email is: VC@gmail.com



###Question
Examples of Other Methods on Strings

email = "VC@gmail.com"
print(email.upper())

name = "Vinay Ch"
print(name.split(" "))

li = ['Vinay', 'Ch']
print(" ".join(li))

print(email.find("gm"))
